## SoundCheck
This project is an effort to sample _Taan_ from a given _Raag_. Now, the meanings of the words _Taan_ and _Raag_ in the context of this project are given later on. The content of this project is two-fold which I am going to mention here from an overall perspective.

1. A scripting language is defined, through which the user can provide a _Raag_. We will talk about what this exactly means.
2. Some algorithms have been decided upon to be used for generating _Taan_ for this _Raag_. Though these algorithms will have to be improved to improve the performance and basically has to move toward solving the problem, "What capacities enable human beings to generate _Taan_ for a given _Raag_ ?".

#### What is a Raag ?
It is hard to explain what a raag is. Exponents of the Indian classical music tradition have been unanimously of this opinion. Now I here will try to define the subject as interpreted in this project. Here the _Raag_ is interpreted as a hierarchical syntactic structure with musical notes as terminals. A _Raag_ in my view is an infinite set of distinct sequences of notes. And the only way to capture and represent an infinte set is to have a generative structure. So a _Raag_ here is essentially a generative structure.

#### What is a Taan ?
A _Taan_ is basically a sequence of notes sampled from a _Raag_ and distributed over a given bit scheme or _Taal_.
